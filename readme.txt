Add Vitals, and Set Date/Time

Task 1 - Medication adding and tracking
To add pills, click the settings button in the bottom right, then click Add Pills. To view Medication, click the medication button.

Task 2 - Vitals Monitoring
To view vitals, click the vitals button. And the view the emergency page click the emergency button.  

The emergency page may display if the randomly generated vitals get outside of acceptable ranges for longer than 5 seconds. (It happens randomly, there was a video of it on our HW3 submission though, and its functionality is unchanged.) You can also manually display the emergency page by clicking the emergency button.
